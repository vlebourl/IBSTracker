## ‚è∞ Time Windows

### Clinical Standards
- **Primary finding**: Postprandial symptoms typically occur **within 3 hours** of eating
- **Current practice**: Most studies use 3-4 hour windows
- **Meal challenge tests**: Track symptoms every 30 minutes up to 240 minutes (4 hours)

### Our Current Implementation
- **Current**: 6-hour window
- **Recommendation**: Reduce to **3 hours** for better accuracy

**Rationale**:
- Longer windows increase false positives (unrelated foods get blamed)
- 3 hours aligns with gastrocolic reflex timing
- Matches clinical research standards

## üçΩÔ∏è Meal-Level Analysis

### Meal Definition (Research Standard)
- **Meal**: All foods consumed within **30-minute window**
- **Snacks**: If within 30 minutes of meal, included as part of meal
- **New meal**: After 30-minute gap

### Example from Research
```
10:00 AM: Coffee + Milk + Toast [MEAL 1]
10:15 AM: Banana              [MEAL 1 - within 30 min]
10:45 AM: Apple               [MEAL 2 - new meal after gap]
```

### Symptom Attribution
When symptom occurs at 1:00 PM (3 hours later):
- Analyze at **meal level**, not individual food level
- Check: Did "Coffee + Milk + Toast" meal trigger?
- Check: Did "Apple" meal trigger?

**Why meal-level?**
- Impossible to isolate which food in a meal caused symptom
- Nutrients interact (e.g., fat slows digestion)
- Clinical research uses this approach

## üìä Statistical Methods Used in Research

### Individual vs Population Analysis
- **Key finding**: Analysis is **per-person**, not population-wide
- What triggers you ‚â† what triggers others
- IBS is highly heterogeneous

### Correlation Methods
1. **Spearman correlation coefficient** (most common)
   - Non-parametric (no assumptions about distribution)
   - Measures strength of association
   - Range: -1 (perfect negative) to +1 (perfect positive)

2. **Linear regression** with feature selection
   - Stanford study approach
   - Used for nutrient analysis

3. **Significance testing (P-values)**
   - P ‚â§ 0.001: Very strong association (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
   - P ‚â§ 0.05: Strong association (‚≠ê‚≠ê)
   - P > 0.05: Weak/not significant (‚≠ê)

### Handling Collinearity
**Problem**: Some foods/nutrients are highly correlated
- Example: High-fat foods also high in calories
- Can't tell if fat OR calories is the trigger

**Solution (Stanford study)**:
- Calculate pairwise correlations between all nutrients
- If correlation > 0.75, remove one
- Keep nutrient with "highest average correlation"

**Example**:
```
Coffee + Milk meal:
- Caffeine: 180mg
- Lactose: 12g
- Calories: 150

Coffee (alone) meal:
- Caffeine: 180mg
- Lactose: 0g
- Calories: 5

If both Coffee+Milk and Coffee (alone) have 0.85 correlation,
remove one to avoid double-counting.
```

## üéØ Existing App Approaches

### mySymptoms Food Diary (Commercial)
- AI algorithm with configurable lag times
- Statistical correlation analysis
- Shows "suspect foods" with confidence levels
- Proprietary algorithm (details not public)

### MyFoodPal (Research Project)
- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost algorithm
- **Inputs**: Concentration of foods consumed (portion size matters!)
- **Outputs**: Predicted symptom scores
- **Analysis**:
  - Spearman correlation per food group
  - K-means clustering to find associations
  - PCA for dimensionality reduction

### Stanford Study Results
- **73%** of participants had ‚â•1 strong food-symptom association (P‚â§0.05)
- Individual regression per participant (personalized)
- 4-hour symptom window
- Feature selection to remove correlated nutrients

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Challenges

### 1. Causality vs Correlation
- **Cannot prove causation** from diary data alone
- Could be reverse causality:
  - Symptoms ‚Üí food choices (feel bad ‚Üí eat comfort food)
  - Not: Food ‚Üí symptoms

### 2. Confounding Variables Not Accounted For
Research acknowledges these factors are NOT controlled:
- Stress levels
- Time of day (circadian rhythm)
- Day of week
- Medications
- Sleep quality
- Hormonal cycles (women)
- Physical activity

### 3. Dose-Dependent Reactions
- Small portion = no symptom
- Large portion = symptom
- Most analyses don't track portion size
- **MyFoodPal exception**: Uses concentration/amount

### 4. Confirmation Rates
From the 164-patient study:
- Statistical analysis: **75% helpful** as elimination guide
- Re-testing confirmation: **47%** confirmed
- **~50% false positive rate** expected

### 5. Individual Variability
- "IBS and IBD are heterogeneous conditions"
- "Patients often respond differently to the same food"
- 85-90% of IBS patients report food-related symptoms
- But triggers vary person-to-person

## üî¨ Research-Based Algorithm (Ideal)

### Step-by-Step Process

```
For each symptom:
  1. Look back 3 hours (symptom window)

  2. Group foods into meals:
     - Foods within 30 min = same meal
     - Calculate meal occurrence count

  3. For each unique meal:
     - Count: Times this meal ‚Üí symptom (triggered)
     - Count: Times this meal ‚Üí no symptom (not triggered)
     - Calculate correlation coefficient (Spearman)
     - Calculate P-value (statistical significance)

  4. Remove highly correlated meals:
     - If two meals have correlation > 0.75
     - Keep meal with higher occurrence count

  5. Rank meals:
     - By correlation strength (high to low)
     - Filter: Only show if P ‚â§ 0.05

  6. Display with confidence levels:
     - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Very Strong: P ‚â§ 0.001
     - ‚≠ê‚≠ê Strong: P ‚â§ 0.05
     - ‚≠ê Weak: P > 0.05 (don't show)
```

### Required Data
- **Minimum occurrences**: 5-10 per meal for meaningful P-values
- **Study standard**: 15-20+ entries for reliable statistics
- **Trade-off**: More data = higher confidence, but slower insights

## ü§î Key Questions for Implementation

### 1. Simple Counting vs Statistical Analysis?
- **Simple**: Count triggered vs total occurrences (%)
- **Statistical**: Calculate correlation + P-values
- **Trade-off**: Simplicity vs accuracy

### 2. Minimum Data Requirements?
- **Research standard**: 15-20 entries
- **Practical**: Show analysis even with 3-5 entries?
- **Trade-off**: Early insights vs false positives

### 3. Meal-Level Only or Individual Foods Too?
- **Research**: Meal-level analysis
- **User need**: "Is it the milk or the coffee?"
- **Hybrid**: Show both?

### 4. Portion Size Tracking?
- **Research**: Dose-dependent reactions exist
- **Current**: We don't track portions
- **Future**: Add quantity tracking?
