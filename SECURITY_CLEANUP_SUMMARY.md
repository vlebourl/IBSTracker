# Security Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the security improvements made to the IBS Tracker repository.

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

### 1. **Removed Secrets from Git History**
- ‚úÖ Completely removed `app/release-keystore.jks` from all commits (commit 5f70a09 and onwards)
- ‚úÖ Removed hardcoded passwords from `build.gradle.kts` history
- ‚úÖ Used `git-filter-repo` to rewrite history safely
- ‚úÖ Verified removal with `git log --all --full-history`

### 2. **Migrated to Secure Configuration**
- ‚úÖ Created `keystore.properties` for storing signing credentials locally (git-ignored)
- ‚úÖ Updated `app/build.gradle.kts` to read from `keystore.properties`
- ‚úÖ Added fallback to environment variables for CI/CD
- ‚úÖ Created `keystore.properties.example` template for contributors

### 3. **Updated .gitignore**
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive patterns for keystores (`*.jks`, `*.keystore`, `*.p12`, `*.key`, `*.pem`)
- ‚úÖ Added patterns for secrets files (`client_secret*.json`, `keystore.properties`, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Added Android best practices (APKs, build artifacts, etc.)

### 4. **Fixed Google OAuth Configuration**
- ‚úÖ Updated OAuth Client ID to real value
- ‚úÖ Fixed `GoogleAuthManager.kt` permission check bug (inverted logic)
- ‚úÖ Updated `google-services.json` with correct project details

### 5. **Created Documentation**
- ‚úÖ `SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide with security best practices
- ‚úÖ `QUICKSTART.md` - Quick reference for new developers
- ‚úÖ `keystore.properties.example` - Template for signing configuration

### 6. **Backed Up Critical Files**
- ‚úÖ Original keystore backed up to: `~/Documents/IBSTracker-release-keystore.jks.backup`

## üîê Current Security Status

### Files in Repository (Safe)
- ‚úÖ `google-services.json` - Protected by package name + SHA-1
- ‚úÖ OAuth Client ID in `strings.xml` - Public by design, protected by SHA-1
- ‚úÖ `keystore.properties.example` - Template only, no real values
- ‚úÖ All code and configuration files

### Files NOT in Repository (Secure)
- üîí `app/release-keystore.jks` - Your signing key
- üîí `keystore.properties` - Contains passwords
- üîí `client_secret*.json` - OAuth secrets
- üîí `local.properties` - SDK paths and local config

### Files Cleaned from History
- ‚úÖ `app/release-keystore.jks` - Completely removed
- ‚úÖ Hardcoded passwords in old `build.gradle.kts` - Replaced with secure loading

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Next Steps Required

### Step 1: Force Push to GitHub (Required!)

Your local repository has a **rewritten history** that removed the keystore. You need to force push this to GitHub:

```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This will overwrite the remote history
# Make sure all collaborators are aware before doing this!

# Push the cleaned history
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/google-integration

# If that fails, use force push (be careful!)
git push --force origin feature/google-integration
```

### Step 2: Notify Collaborators

If anyone else has cloned the repository, they need to:

```bash
# Backup their local work first!
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/feature/google-integration
```

### Step 3: Revoke the Compromised Keystore (Recommended)

Since `release-keystore.jks` was in the public git history, it's compromised. For production:

1. **Generate a new keystore:**
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore app/release-keystore-new.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -alias release-key
```

2. **Update your `keystore.properties`:**
```properties
storeFile=app/release-keystore-new.jks
storePassword=NEW_SECURE_PASSWORD
keyAlias=release-key
keyPassword=NEW_SECURE_PASSWORD
```

3. **Register the new SHA-1 in Google Cloud Console:**
```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore app/release-keystore-new.jks \
  -alias release-key -storepass YOUR_PASSWORD
```

4. **For Google Play Store:** If you've already published with the old keystore, you'll need to keep using it (Google Play enforces keystore consistency). For future apps, use the new one.

### Step 4: Update Google Cloud Console

Your new SHA-1 fingerprint needs to be registered:

```
Current SHA-1 (old keystore): DD:DA:AC:4F:AB:46:73:AE:56:C9:FB:CD:68:8E:EF:90:15:21:B4:79
```

If you generate a new keystore, add the new SHA-1 to:
- Google Cloud Console ‚Üí APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials
- OAuth 2.0 Client ID for Android

## üìã Verification Checklist

- [x] Keystore removed from git history
- [x] Hardcoded passwords removed
- [x] `.gitignore` updated
- [x] Secure configuration system in place
- [x] Documentation created
- [x] Keystore backed up
- [ ] **Force push to GitHub** ‚Üê YOU NEED TO DO THIS
- [ ] **Generate new keystore** (recommended)
- [ ] **Update Google Cloud Console** (if new keystore)

## üîÑ Setting Up on a New Machine

Anyone cloning the repo will need to:

1. Copy `keystore.properties.example` to `keystore.properties`
2. Either:
   - **Option A:** Generate their own keystore for testing
   - **Option B:** Request the production keystore from you (securely!)
3. Follow `QUICKSTART.md` for detailed steps

## üìû Support

If you have questions about:
- **Forcing the push:** Make sure you understand it will rewrite remote history
- **The new keystore:** Keep it in a secure password manager
- **Setting up on other machines:** Follow QUICKSTART.md

**‚úÖ Security Status:** Your repository is now secure, but you must force push to update GitHub!
