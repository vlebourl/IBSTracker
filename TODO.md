* create a single row quick add on top of the food categories with the 2, 3 or 4 most added items, this short list is "dynamical" and recomputed from food history each time a new item is added, and sorted from most added to least one. arrange in a single row, with relevant icon. don't add an item if it's only seen a single time in the food history.
* refactor the symptom page to match the style and functionalities of the food page.
* run a global analysis of style and UI/UX and create a plan to realign on latest material design recommendations.
* Update the food quick add to add a confirmation popup before we add (for instance: category beverage -> coffee -> *confirm the date and time with current as default* instead of  category beverage -> coffee -> added with current datetime.)
* add a medication part in the "symptoms" tab, maybe rename the tab? the medication could indicate taking stuff like omeprazole, Gaviscon, lop√©ramide, etc (you may suggest others)
* automatic daily backup
