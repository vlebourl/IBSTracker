# Specification Quality Checklist: Improved Analysis Insights

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All clarifications resolved: 8-hour time window selected with weighted correlation based on temporal proximity and trigger impact levels
- Added FR-016 through FR-021 for probability-based trigger analysis
- Added FR-022 through FR-031 for Material Design UI/UX requirements
- Specification now includes symptom-centric view with probability percentages (e.g., "Diarrhea: Coffee (47%), Cheese (85%), Tomato (98%)")
- All checklist items pass validation
- Spec is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
