## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 components but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1 components but independently testable  
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1 analysis results but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Analysis engine components before UI components
- Data models before business logic
- Core functionality before advanced features
- Basic UI before enhanced interactions
- Story core complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, different user stories can start in parallel
- Within each user story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Polish tasks marked [P] can all run in parallel after user stories complete

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch core analysis components together:
Task: "Create TriggerAnalyzer main orchestrator"
Task: "Implement temporal proximity calculation in CorrelationCalculator.kt"
Task: "Implement baseline trigger probability lookup in ProbabilityEngine.kt"

# Launch UI components together:
Task: "Create SymptomCard composable"
Task: "Create TriggerProbabilityBar composable"
Task: "Create SeverityIndicator composable"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo basic symptom-trigger analysis

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Enhanced insights)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full filtering)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Natural language)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Core analysis)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Correlation explanations)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Filtering system)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Natural language insights)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
