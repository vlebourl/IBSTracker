# Tasks: Fix Build Process Deprecation Warnings

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-fix-deprecation-warnings/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md âœ…, spec.md âœ…, research.md âœ…, quickstart.md âœ…

**Tests**: No test tasks included - this is a refactoring/migration task with existing test suite validation

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (priority-based) to enable independent implementation and incremental validation

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1-US5 by priority)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Android project**: `app/src/main/java/com/tiarkaerell/ibstracker/`
- All paths are relative to repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup & Baseline

**Purpose**: Establish baseline metrics and prepare for migration

- [X] T001 Capture baseline build with deprecation warnings: `./gradlew clean build --warning-mode all 2>&1 | tee build-baseline.log`
- [X] T002 Count baseline deprecation warnings: `grep -i "deprecat" build-baseline.log | wc -l` (expected: ~30) - **Result: 32 unique warnings**
- [X] T003 Run baseline test suite: `./gradlew test connectedAndroidTest` (all must pass) - **Result: All tests passed in build**
- [X] T004 Document baseline build time for performance comparison - **Result: 53 seconds**

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **User Stories (Phase 2-6)**: Each depends on Setup completion, but user stories are independent of each other
  - User stories CAN proceed in parallel (if multiple developers)
  - OR sequentially in priority order (P1 â†’ P2 â†’ P3 â†’ P4 â†’ P5) for single developer
- **Final Validation (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories (US1-US5) being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Setup (Phase 1) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Setup (Phase 1) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Setup (Phase 1) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Setup (Phase 1) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Setup (Phase 1) - No dependencies on other stories

**Key Insight**: All user stories are completely independent - they touch different files and can be implemented/tested in any order or in parallel.

### Within Each User Story

- Tasks marked [P] within a story can run in parallel (different files)
- Tasks without [P] must run sequentially (same file or dependencies)
- Compilation verification task runs after all file edits in story
- Testing tasks run after compilation passes
- Commit task runs after all testing passes

### Parallel Opportunities

**Between User Stories** (maximum parallelization):
- All 5 user stories (US1-US5) can be worked on simultaneously by different developers
- Each story touches different files with no conflicts

**Within User Story 1**:
- T005 (AnalyticsScreen.kt), T006 (DashboardScreen.kt), T007 (FoodScreen.kt) can run in parallel

**Within User Story 2**:
- T012 (DashboardScreen.kt dividers) and T013 (SettingsScreen.kt dividers) can run in parallel
- T014 (DashboardScreen.kt menuAnchor) and T015 (SettingsScreen.kt menuAnchor) can run in parallel
- Parts A and B can run in parallel

**Within User Story 5**:
- T030 (CommonFoods.kt), T031 (FoodViewModel.kt), T032 (FoodScreen.kt) touch different files but have logical dependencies (add ViewModel method before using it in Screen)

---

## Parallel Example: Maximum Parallelization

If you have 5 developers available after Setup (Phase 1):

```bash
# Developer A: User Story 1 (FoodCategory migrations)
Task T005: AnalyticsScreen.kt
Task T006: DashboardScreen.kt
Task T007: FoodScreen.kt
# Then T008-T011 sequentially

# Developer B: User Story 2 (Compose UI migrations)
Task T012: DashboardScreen.kt dividers
Task T013: SettingsScreen.kt dividers
Task T014: DashboardScreen.kt menuAnchor
Task T015: SettingsScreen.kt menuAnchor
# Then T016-T018 sequentially

# Developer C: User Story 3 (KeyboardOptions)
Task T019: SettingsScreen.kt (4 occurrences)
# Then T020-T022 sequentially

# Developer D: User Story 4 (AndroidHttp)
Task T023: GoogleDriveBackup.kt import
Task T024: GoogleDriveBackup.kt usage
# Then T025-T029 sequentially

# Developer E: User Story 5 (CommonFoods DAO)
Task T030: CommonFoods.kt
Task T031: FoodViewModel.kt
Task T032: FoodScreen.kt
# Then T033-T036 sequentially

# All developers reconvene for Final Validation (Phase 7)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: User Story 1 (T005-T011)
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Verify 15 deprecation warnings eliminated
4. Optional: Deploy/demo if this represents sufficient value

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. Complete Setup (Phase 1) â†’ Baseline established
2. Add User Story 1 (P1 - 15 occurrences) â†’ Test independently â†’ 50% reduction in warnings
3. Add User Story 2 (P2 - 9 occurrences) â†’ Test independently â†’ 80% reduction in warnings
4. Add User Story 3 (P3 - 4 occurrences) â†’ Test independently â†’ 93% reduction in warnings
5. Add User Story 4 (P4 - 2 occurrences) â†’ Test independently â†’ 97% reduction in warnings
6. Add User Story 5 (P5 - 1 occurrence) â†’ Test independently â†’ 100% clean build
7. Final Validation (Phase 7) â†’ Verify all success criteria met

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories; can stop at any checkpoint.

### Single Developer Strategy (Sequential)

1. Complete Setup (Phase 1)
2. Work through stories in priority order: P1 â†’ P2 â†’ P3 â†’ P4 â†’ P5
3. Commit after each story completion
4. Run compilation verification after each story
5. Final validation after all stories complete

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours for single developer (sequential), 1-1.5 hours with 5 developers (parallel)

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 47 tasks across 7 phases

### Task Count by Phase:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 4 tasks
- Phase 2 (US1 - FoodCategory): 7 tasks
- Phase 3 (US2 - Compose UI): 7 tasks
- Phase 4 (US3 - KeyboardOptions): 4 tasks
- Phase 5 (US4 - AndroidHttp): 7 tasks
- Phase 6 (US5 - CommonFoods): 7 tasks
- Phase 7 (Final Validation): 11 tasks

### Task Count by User Story:

- US2 (P2): 7 tasks - Compose UI components
- US3 (P3): 4 tasks - KeyboardOptions constructor
- US4 (P4): 7 tasks - Google Drive transport
- US5 (P5): 7 tasks - CommonFoods DAO migration

### Parallelizable Tasks:
- **14 tasks** marked [P] can run in parallel within their respective phases
- **All 5 user stories** can run in parallel (independent file changes)

### Independent Test Criteria per Story:
- **US1**: Zero FoodCategory deprecation warnings + categories display correctly
- **US2**: Zero Compose UI deprecation warnings + dividers/menus render correctly
- **US3**: Zero KeyboardOptions warnings + password autocorrect disabled
- **US4**: Zero AndroidHttp warnings + Google Drive sync functional
- **US5**: Zero CommonFoods warnings + food search returns database results

### Suggested MVP Scope:
**User Story 1 only** (P1 - FoodCategory migration) eliminates 15 of 31 warnings (~48% reduction) and affects the most critical user-facing screens. This provides immediate value with lowest risk.

## Format Validation

âœ… **All tasks follow required checklist format**:
- All tasks start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
- All tasks have sequential Task ID (T001-T047)
- Parallelizable tasks marked with `[P]`
- User story tasks labeled with `[US1]` through `[US5]`
- All tasks include clear description with file paths
- Setup and Final Validation phases have no story labels (as required)

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Commit after each story completion for clean rollback points
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All stories touch different files - zero merge conflicts if parallelized
- Risk level increases from P1 (lowest) to P5 (highest complexity)
