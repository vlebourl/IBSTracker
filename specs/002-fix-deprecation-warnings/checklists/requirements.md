# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Build Process Deprecation Warnings

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses on developer/build system outcomes rather than implementation details
- Written from the perspective of business value (clean builds, maintainability, compatibility)
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope, Assumptions, Dependencies, Risks) are completed
- No framework-specific implementation details in requirements

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 12 functional requirements are testable (e.g., "MUST compile without warnings", "MUST replace with HorizontalDivider")
- Success criteria include specific metrics (zero warnings, 15+ occurrences replaced, build time within 5%)
- All 10 success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable
- Acceptance scenarios cover all 5 user stories with concrete Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases identify potential issues (API equivalence, parameter behavior, internationalization)
- Scope clearly defines in-scope (API migration, visual parity) and out-of-scope (new features, refactoring)
- 10 assumptions documented, 8 dependencies identified

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
- Each of 12 functional requirements maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- 5 user stories prioritized (P1-P5) covering all deprecation categories identified in build
- Success criteria align with feature goal (zero deprecation warnings, specific occurrence counts)
- No implementation details (specific classes/methods are in context, not in requirements)

## Overall Status

✅ **READY FOR PLANNING** - All checklist items pass. Specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

No issues requiring resolution. The spec successfully addresses all deprecation warnings identified in the build process across 5 categories:
1. FoodCategory.getDisplayName (15+ occurrences) - P1
2. Compose UI components (Divider, menuAnchor) - P2
3. KeyboardOptions constructor (4 occurrences) - P3
4. Google Drive AndroidHttp (2 occurrences) - P4
5. CommonFoods helper (1 occurrence) - P5
