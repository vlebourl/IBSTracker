# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Deprecation Compilation Warnings

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: âœ… ALL CHECKS PASSED

The specification is complete and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

### Spec Highlights:

1. **Clear User Stories**: Three prioritized stories covering developer productivity (P1), future compatibility (P2), and code quality metrics (P3)
2. **Comprehensive Requirements**: 7 functional requirements covering all aspects of deprecation warning elimination
3. **Measurable Success**: 5 specific, testable success criteria focused on zero warnings and maintained test coverage
4. **Well-Defined Context**: Detailed breakdown of 13 current deprecation warnings categorized by type
5. **Proper Scope**: Clear boundaries defining what's in and out of scope

### No Clarifications Needed:

This is a technical debt feature with clear, unambiguous requirements:
- Replace deprecated APIs with documented modern equivalents
- Maintain 100% functional parity
- Achieve zero deprecation warnings in build output

All deprecated APIs have well-documented replacements in official Android/Compose documentation, eliminating any need for clarification questions.
