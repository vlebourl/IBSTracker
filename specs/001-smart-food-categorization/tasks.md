# Tasks: Smart Food Categorization System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-smart-food-categorization/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are included based on spec.md requirements (SC-003, SC-007, SC-008 specify explicit testing requirements)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Android mobile app**: `app/src/main/java/com/tiarkaerell/ibstracker/`
- **Tests**: `app/src/test/java/` (unit), `app/src/androidTest/java/` (instrumented)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 3 - Quick Add from Usage-Sorted Shortcuts (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to quickly log frequently-eaten foods via auto-updating shortcuts based on usage patterns

**Independent Test**: Add "Coffee" 5 times, "Bread" 3 times, "Apple" 2 times, verify quick-add section shows them in that order (Coffee, Bread, Apple) due to usage count DESC sorting

**Why MVP First**: Core UX efficiency feature - delivers immediate value to users by surfacing most-used foods. User Story 1 (add new food) depends on quick-add infrastructure, so building quick-add first establishes the foundation.

- [ ] T029 [US3] Add smooth animation for quick-add re-sorting when usage counts change (SC-001: <200ms update latency)

**DAO Tests (SC-008 requirement)**:
- [ ] T030 [P] [US3] Create FoodUsageStatsDaoTest.kt in app/src/androidTest/java/com/tiarkaerell/ibstracker/database/ to test sorting (usage_count DESC, name ASC)
- [ ] T031 [P] [US3] Add test case for quick-add update latency (<200ms) in FoodUsageStatsDaoTest.kt

**Checkpoint**: At this point, quick-add shortcuts should be fully functional - users can see and tap their most-used foods

---

- [ ] T038 [US1] Add category-specific attribute visibility logic (show BEVERAGE attributes only when category = BEVERAGES)
- [ ] T039 [US1] Implement save logic in AddFoodDialog calling repository.insertCommonFood with isCustom = true, isVerified = false
- [ ] T040 [US1] Add search functionality to FoodScreen.kt with fuzzy matching on CommonFood.name and searchTerms (FR-033)

- [ ] T052 [US4] Add Navigation route for CategoryDetailScreen in MainActivity NavHost
- [ ] T053 [US4] Implement sorting logic (usage_count DESC, name ASC) in CategoryDetailScreen StateFlow

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 4 should be fully functional - users can browse foods by category grid

---

## Phase 6: User Story 2 - Edit Existing Food Attributes (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable users to refine food attributes via long-press context menu

**Independent Test**: Navigate to BEVERAGES category, long-press "Coffee", select "Edit Attributes", add ACIDIC checkbox, save, verify attribute appears

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 3 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 4)**: Depends on US3 completion (uses quick-add infrastructure) - Can integrate with US3
- **User Story 4 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Can start after Foundational, integrates with US1
- **User Story 2 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 and US4 completion (edits foods added in US1, uses UI from US4) - Integrates with US1/US4
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1 completion (adds tooltips to US1 dialogs) - Integrates with US1
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - MVP foundation
- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Depends on US3 (uses quick-add infrastructure)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1/US3 but integrates with US1
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on US1 and US4 (edits foods from US1, uses category navigation from US4)
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Depends on US1 (adds education to US1 dialogs)

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before UI components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T002, T003)
- All Foundational entity creation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T005, T006, T008, T009, T012, T013)

## Parallel Example: User Story 3 (Quick Add)

```bash
# Launch DAO tests together:
Task: "Create FoodUsageStatsDaoTest.kt to test sorting"
Task: "Add test case for quick-add update latency (<200ms)"

# Launch ViewModel and UI components together:
Task: "Create FoodUsageStatsViewModel with StateFlow for top 6 foods"
Task: "Create QuickAddCard composable for individual shortcuts"
Task: "Create QuickAddSection composable displaying top 6 foods"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 3 + User Story 1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (3 tasks, ~2 hours)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (19 tasks, ~3-4 days) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 3 (9 tasks, ~2 days) - Quick-add shortcuts MVP
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 1 (13 tasks, ~3 days) - Add new food functionality
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US3 + US1 independently on real device
6. Deploy/demo if ready (v1.9.0-beta1)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (~4 days)
2. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Quick-add MVP! ~2 days)
3. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full add food flow! ~3 days)
4. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Category browsing! ~2 days)
5. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Edit functionality! ~1-2 days)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Education! ~1-2 days)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (~4 days)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 3 (quick-add)
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (category grid) - can start in parallel
3. After US3 complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (add food) - integrates with US3
   - Developer B: Continues US4
4. After US1 and US4 complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 5 (education) - integrates with US1
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (edit) - integrates with US1/US4
5. Both developers: Polish tasks in parallel

---

## Format Validation

‚úÖ All 82 tasks follow the required checklist format:
- Checkbox: `- [ ]` at start
- Task ID: Sequential T001-T082
- [P] marker: 28 tasks marked as parallelizable
- [Story] label: 44 tasks labeled with US1-US5
- Description: Clear action with exact file path
- Setup/Foundational/Polish tasks: No story label (correct)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tests included based on SC-003, SC-007, SC-008 explicit requirements from spec.md
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- Follow Material Design 3 guidelines throughout (FR-042 to FR-047)
- Maintain WCAG AA accessibility compliance (FR-044)
- All database operations must preserve data integrity (FR-006)
- Quick-add updates must be fast (<200ms per FR-048)
