## TODO Items

### Immediate (Blocking Cloud Functionality)
- [ ] **GoogleAuthManager Integration**
  - BackupRepositoryImpl.syncToCloud() needs access token
  - BackupRepositoryImpl.restoreFromBackup() needs access token for cloud backups
  - BackupViewModel needs access token for cloud operations
  - GoogleDriveBackupWorker needs access token storage

### Short Term (Phase 6 Completion)
- [ ] Implement `deleteCloudBackup()` in GoogleDriveBackup
  - Need Drive service instance
  - Use `driveService.files().delete(fileId).execute()`
  - Add proper error handling

- [ ] Update cloud storage usage calculation
  - Currently returns 0L in BackupRepositoryImpl
  - Need to sum cloud backup sizes
  - Display in BackupStatusCard

### Medium Term (Polish)
- [ ] Performance profiling (T170-T172)
  - Verify local backup <200ms
  - Verify restore <3s
  - Verify cloud upload <10s on WiFi

- [ ] Security review (T173-T175)
  - Verify DRIVE_APPDATA scope (not full DRIVE)
  - Verify checksum verification on all restores
  - Verify WAL checkpoint before all backups

- [ ] Manual testing scenarios (T178-T180)
  - Complete backup→modify→restore→verify cycle
  - Verify backup file cleanup (7 local, 30 cloud)
  - Test all quickstart.md scenarios

## Summary

**Phase 6-8 Status:** ✅ **CORE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

Successfully implemented:
- Complete cloud restore infrastructure (download → verify → restore → cleanup)
- Reactive cloud backup observation (Flow-based)
- Settings and configuration (already complete from Phase 4-5)
- Code quality verification (documentation, cleanup, TODO review)
- Build verification (all code compiles successfully)

Pending integration:
- GoogleAuthManager access token retrieval (affects all cloud operations)
- Cloud backup deletion implementation
- Performance profiling and manual testing

The Auto-Backup System is now feature-complete for cloud restore functionality, with only GoogleAuthManager integration remaining before full end-to-end testing can be performed.
