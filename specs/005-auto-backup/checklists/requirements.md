# Specification Quality Checklist: Automatic Backup System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED

### Content Quality Review
- ✅ No implementation details found - spec focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- ✅ User-centric language throughout all user stories
- ✅ Business value clearly stated in priority explanations
- ✅ All mandatory sections present and complete

### Requirement Completeness Review
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete
- ✅ All 35 functional requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria
- ✅ All 16 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on user outcomes like "under 200ms", "under 3 seconds", "90% reduction")
- ✅ All 5 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios (Given/When/Then format)
- ✅ Comprehensive edge cases documented (12 scenarios across local/cloud/restore/performance)
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded with "Out of Scope" section listing 10 excluded items
- ✅ Dependencies explicitly listed (8 items) and assumptions documented (10 items)

### Feature Readiness Review
- ✅ All 35 functional requirements map directly to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ User scenarios cover complete workflows: backup creation, restore, cloud sync, settings
- ✅ Success criteria are achievable and measurable without knowing implementation
- ✅ No leakage of technical details (WorkManager, Room, Jetpack Compose mentioned only in Dependencies, not Requirements)

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- All checklist items passed on first validation
- No clarifications needed - feature is well-defined from comprehensive input document
- Feature follows independent testing principle - each user story can be developed/tested/deployed independently
- Priority ordering is clear: P0 (local backup/restore) → P1 (cloud backup/restore) → P2 (settings)
